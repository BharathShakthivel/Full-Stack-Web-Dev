## üîç How It Works

The **Simon Game** is a memory-based game where players repeat an increasing sequence of colors generated by the game. Here's how it works:

### 1. **Game Initialization**

* The game starts when the user presses any key (or clicks the start button, if implemented).
* The game sets the **level** to 0 and initializes an empty sequence.

### 2. **Game Sequence Generation**

* At the beginning of each level, the game:

  * Increments the **level counter**.
  * Randomly selects one color from the set of available colors (`["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]`).
  * Adds the selected color to the game sequence.
  * Animates and plays a sound for the new color to show the player.

### 3. **User Interaction**

* The player clicks on the colored buttons to repeat the sequence.
* Each time the player clicks a button:

  * The button is animated briefly.
  * The corresponding sound plays.
  * The color is added to the user‚Äôs input pattern.

### 4. **Checking the User‚Äôs Input**

* After each click, the game checks the user‚Äôs input against the game sequence:

  * If the latest input matches the corresponding position in the sequence:

    * If the user has completed the entire sequence, the game proceeds to the next level after a short delay.
  * If the input is incorrect:

    * The game plays a **wrong sound**.
    * The background flashes to indicate **Game Over**.
    * The game resets the level and sequence, prompting the user to restart.

### 5. **Game Over and Restart**

* When the user makes a mistake:

  * The game shows a **Game Over** message.
  * The player can start a new game by pressing a key again.
